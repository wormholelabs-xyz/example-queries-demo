## Queries Demo

This is a trivial demo of using [Wormhole Queries](https://wormhole.com/queries/) to sync counters across EVM chains. A counter can only be incremented if a query containing recent counter data from the other registered contracts is provided.

Check out the [Demo UI](https://vaa.dev/#/ccq) as well.

Learn more about developing with Queries in [the docs](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/queries/getting-started).
